title:  "My Fascination With Web Development"
---

It should not be a secret that I am pursuing a career in back-end development, but that brings up the question of why I have so many front-end web development projects. So far I have 4: My portfolio website, the clicker game on the site, my web-based dungeon crawler game, and even this blog. I even had 2 internships that were primarily web development. I have been fascinated by web development for almost the past year, but why?

### All Engineers Should Learn Front-End Development

The first reason for my recent fascination is that I believe all engineers should understand front-end development. A big part of designing a back-end is how it interacts with the front-end. In some cases, limitations of the front-end might change how the back-end can be organized. For example, when plotting a graph in Python using matplotlib, it takes the data as a list. For efficiency, it would be best to design the backend the code to manipulate that data in a list or a data structure that can be easily converted to a list. This is a very simple example, and there are certainly more complicated cases where large programs can be designed in a way that makes the user interface difficult to develop. If every back-end developer had front-end experience, they might better understand how the code they write effects the front-end.

### There Are So Many Resources

A big reason that I chose the web over other front-end applications is because of the amount of resources that make it easy to learn. I first made a few attempts to learn the Swing library in Java. Because there are not very many resources, the only way to learn it is to read through the inane amount of documentation. Working on these projects on my own time, made this very difficult. On the other hand, web development has a lot of resources. A majority of the documentation is written in easy and concise language and organized in a way that makes finding specific concepts easy. Additionally, there are a good amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow that help to solve problems that the documentation cannot answer. All of this makes web development easier to learn than front-end any other languages I have tried.

### It Is a Big Part of Our Lives

Not only are some very big platforms like Facebook and Twitter based on the web, but portability of web applications is enticing developers to make web apps instead of mobile or desktop applications. Desktop and mobile applications often must be reprogrammed for each device. iOS applications have only a few proprietary programming languages. Android has a wider variety of languages, but none in common with iOS. In order to create an app for both platforms, it must be programed twice. A web application programed to respond to various screen sizes can be used on all devices with a browser without the need for reprogramming. More importantly, the user does not have to download the app or log in in order to access it. 

### Learning Back-End Through Front-End Development

In the movie, Karate Kid, Mr. Miyagi had Daniel do menial tasks like painting his fence and waxing his car. Tasks that did not seem relevant to learning karate. After a while, Daniel discovered that these were, in fact, teaching him muscle memory that made him better at karate. I believe web development to have the same effect for a back-end developer. It should go without saying that front-end development will not teach you some of the most important parts of back-end development in the same way that Daniel could not learn everything about karate by doing Mr. Miyagi's chores. Front-end, however, does provide lessons about back-end development that would not be learned from back-end alone.
