title:  "My Fascination With Web Development"
---

It should not be a secret that I am persuing a career in back-end development, but that might bring up the question of why I have so many front-end web development projects. So far I have 4. My portfolio website, the clicker game on the site, my web-based dungeon crawler game, and even this blog. I even had 2 internships that were primarily web development. I have been fascinated by web development for almost the past year, but why?

### All Engineers Should Learn Front-End Development

The first reason for my recent fascination is that I believe all engineers should understand front-end development. A big part of designing a backend is how it interracts with the front-end in some cases, limitations of the front-end might change how the back-end can be organized. For example, making when plot a graph in Python with matplotlib it takes a list of data. For efficiency, it would be best to design the rest of the code to manipulate that data in a list or a data structure that can be easily converted to a list. This is a very simple example, and there are certainly more complicated cases where large programs can be designed in a way that makes the user interface difficult to develop. If every back-end developer had front-end experience, they might be able to better understand how the UI should interract with the back-end.


### There Is So Much To Learn

The next reason is that there is so much to learn about web development. There's so many JavaScript frameworks, there are constantly new tools being developed like Bootstrap that make design easier, and there is even a new web language called Web Assembly that might change the way we code websites. CSS, the language used to add color and design to sites, is a complicated tool on its own. There are insane amounts of different ways to do one thing. Putting two things side by side while keeping it mobile friendly can be done with media queries, a CSS grid, or with Bootstrap. With recent updates, HTML and CSS are turing complete which only adds to the appeal. There are so many resources for learning web development. More so than I have found for any other language.

### There Are So Many Resources

A big reason that I chose the web over other front-end applications is because there are so many resources that make it easy to learn. I first made a few small attempts to learn Java Swing, but because there are not very many resources, the only way to learn is to read through the inane amount of documentation. Working on these projects on my own time, made this very difficult. On the other hand, web development has a lot of resources. A majority of the documentation is written in easy language that is easy to understand. Additionally, there are a good amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow that help to solve small, specific problems. All of this makes web development easier to learn than front-end for other languages.

### It Is a Big Part of Our Lives

Web development is a very big part of our lives. Not only are some very big platforms like Facebook and Twitter based on the web, but portability of web applications is enticing developers to make web apps instead of mobile or desktop applications. Desktop and mobile applications often must be reprogrammed for each device. iOS applications have only a few proprietary programming langues. Android has a wider variety of languages, but none in common with iOS. In order to create an app for both platforms, it must be programmed twice. A web application programmed to respond to various screen sizes can be used on all devices with a browser without the need for reprogramming. More importantly, the user does not have to download the app or log in in order to access it.
