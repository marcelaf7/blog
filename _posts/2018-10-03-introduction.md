# Introduction

My name is Marcel Fiore. I am a senior in Computer Science at Colorado State University, and this is my first ever official blog post. I had a Tumblr account in the past, which is technically a "blog", but I mostly used it to look at and share funny memes and pictures of cute animals. I am starting this blog to share my adventures in coding projects. I plan to share things like why I approached them the way I did, and how I solved problems that others may benefit from.

The current project I am working on, which I will go more in depth on in another post is an HTML/JavaScript based rogue-like dungeon crawler. Lots of words, I know. The important part of the project is that I needed to create a random dungeon generator. While researching it, I stumbled upon a blog post written by Notch, the creator of Minecraft. In the blog post, he went into detail about how the terrain generator in the game works, how it worked in early development of the game, and why he changed it later on. It inspired me to create this blog.

Knowing that people like me are interested in reading a blog about the problems and solutions that go in to coding projects was insanely inspiring. That night, I actually opened the notes of my phone and wrote down my findings on the dungeon generator and how I planned to go about it. I guess technically that was my first blog post, so this would be my second. I will be posting that one soon.
